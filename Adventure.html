      <p>
        Adventure India welcomes you to a new and unique concept of tourism.
        Generally most of the people in our country use their holidays for
        site-seeing and some to enjoy adventure. An adventure is an exciting
        experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky.
        Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger
        such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba
        diving, river rafting or participating in extreme sports.

        Uttarakhand is one of the most popular adventure destinations in India.
        Especially for its treks! The Roopkund trek is one of a kind trek that
        leads one to the Roopkund Lake, which is surrounded by hundreds of human
        skeletons. Not just the Roopkund trek, but Uttarakhand is known for
        hosting a lot of other magnificent treks like the Nag Tibba Trek,
        Kalka-Kasauli trek and so on. Do make sure that you plan the trip during
        the right season since trekking is not open throughout the year.
