      <p>
        A pilgrimage is a journey, often into an unknown or foreign place, where
        a person goes in search of new or expanded meaning about their self,
        others, nature, or a higher good, through the experience. It can lead to
        a personal transformation, after which the pilgrim returns to their
        daily life. India is known throughout the world for its spirituality.
        People from various religions live here in harmony while following their
        own religious beliefs. Although, secularism is one of the great features
        of the country, spirituality, forgiveness, purity of the heart and
        humanity are given equal importance and people try to live their lives
        according to these. This is the reason why people from all across the
        country visit various religious places and pilgrimage tourism is on the
        rise. There are numerous pilgrimage destinations in India that are
        visited by thousands of followers every year. Even those who are just
        interested in admiring the architecture and understanding the culture
        visit these pilgrimage places, though not from a religious point of
        view. Some of these popular pilgrimage destinations are discussed below
        so that it can be easier for you to plan your spiritual tour.

        Madurai is a temple town in the state of Tamil Nadu. It holds great
        religious importance as it is believed that drops of honey fell from the
        hair of Lord Shiva who had come in the dreams of the king of Madurai and
        hence the city has got its name. The place is also famous for the
        Meenakshi Amman Temple which is one of the most popular temples in
        India. Meenakshi Temple is main attraction of any Pilgrimage traveler to
        Madurai. Meenakshi Temple at Madurai was originally built by Kulasekara
        Pandya and is dedicated to Lord Shiva. ... Two Arupadaiveedus Temples
        (abodes of Lord Muruga) are situated near Madurai viz. Tirupparangunram
        (5 kms), Pazhamudircholai (10 kms).
        Besides its Pilgrimage importance, even for an average heritage traveler visit to the Meenakshi temple complex is nothing short of an experience.

        Rameshwaram is known as temple town and has a great mythological
        background. Apart from the Ramanathaswamy Temple, the city has other
        popular spots such as Adam’s bridge, rail route built over sea and Palk
        Strait. People visit Rameshwaram to wash away their sins, as per Hindu
        religion. There are many other temples like Kothandaramaswamy Temple,
        Gandhamathana Parvatham and four temples of Shiva, which are popular
        amongst pilgrims. Together with Varanasi, it is considered to be one of
        the holiest places in India to Hindus, and part of the Char Dham
        pilgrimage. According to Hindu ancient texts, Lord Ram had built a
        bridge from here across the sea to Lanka to rescue his wife Sita from
        her abductor Ravana.
        According to the Hindu mythology Lord Rama performed thanksgiving rituals to Lord Shiva after his triumph over the demon king Ravana. It is mainly because of this reason that Rameshwaram attracts Vaishnavites and Shaivites alike. Sri Lanka is at a distance of 24 kilometers from Rameshwaram. Rameshwaram happens to one of the most visited pilgrim sites in India. The Rameshwaram Island occupies an area of about 61.8 sq km and is conch shaped.

        Millions of pilgrims visit Varanasi in order to purify themselves by
        bathing in the River Ganges at sunrise. Some Hindus believe that if they
        die at Varanasi, they might be able to attain moksha sooner. Because of
        this, some Hindus go there when they are close to death in order to die
        there. Also known as Banaras, the city is considered to be the religious
        capital of India. It has a number of ancient as well as modern-day
        temples like Vishwanath Temple, Kashi Vishwanath Temple, Dhanvantari

        Kashmir pilgrimage tour includes visits to a number of ancient temples,
        shrines and monasteries. The best point about the pilgrimages of Kashmir
        is that they reflect the peaceful co-existence of various religions in
        the state. A number of famous Hindu temples exist along with equally
        renowned Muslim shrines. And the best part is that these shrines are
        visited by people of every religion. The living proof of this harmony is
        the Hari Parbat pilgrim center. Here, a temple (Hindu), a mosque
        (Muslim) and a gurudwara (Sikh) are standing side by side. Some of the
        famous holy places in Kashmir are: Amarnath, Charar-e-sharif, Hazratbal
        Mosque, Jama Masjid, Kheer Bhavani, Khanqah-e-Moula, Martand Sun Temple,
        Shankaracharya Temple, Shiv Khori, Vaishno Devi, Awantipura, Chatti
        Padshahi, Makhdoom Sahib, Sharika Devi Temple etc. Apart from being the
        most loved honeymoon destination in India, Kashmir is also an important
        pilgrimage spot. Initially, only Hinduism was followed all over Kashmir.
        Buddhism and Islam became popular during the second half of the
        millennium. Shankaracharya Temple, Sharika Devi Temple and Awantipur are
        the main temples here. There is a temple dedicated to the Sun God at
        Anantnag, which is visited by many pilgrims. You will also find many
        mosques and gurudwaras in Kashmir.

        Amarnath Temple is a Hindu shrine located in Jammu and Kashmir, India.
        The cave is situated at an altitude of 3,888 m (12,756 ft),[1] about 141
        km (88 mi) from Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir,
        reached through Pahalgam town. The shrine represents an important part
        of Hinduism,[2] and is considered to be one of the holiest shrines in
        Hinduism.[3] The cave is surrounded by snowy mountains. The cave itself
        is covered with snow most of the year, except for a short period of time
        in summer when it is open to pilgrims. Hundreds of thousands of Hindus
        and other devotees make an annual pilgrimage to the Amarnath cave across
        challenging mountainous terrain. The Amarnath Cave Temple is one of the
        51 Shakti Peethas, temples throughout South Asia that commemorate the
        location of fallen body parts of the Hindu deity Sati. It is famous for
        the holy cave, which houses a naturally formed ‘shivalinga’ of ice. You
        can reach here only after a very difficult trek. The place holds great
        religious importance as it is where Lord Shiva revealed the secret of
        immortality to Parvati which was heard by a pair of pigeons as well.
        These pigeons can be seen in the cave today. Every year, the ‘linga’ is
        created by ice naturally and people visit it through the annual Amarnath
        Yatra.
